##Keith’s amazing revised edition of Myles’ intro to C++ handout

###Intro
Eh, good enough...

Basically programs are things that are filled with conditions and logic (using if and else) that act upon data (input) to provide an output or result.

###Data Types

The basic data types include: **bool**, **char**, **int**, **long**, **float**, and **double**.

A **bool**, also known as a **boolean**, can hold the values of true or false.
